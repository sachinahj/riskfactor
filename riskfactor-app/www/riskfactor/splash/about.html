    <h5>What do our intuitions, misconceptions, or irrational fears say about us? How much are our perceptions based on statistical evidence? uThought is a trivia style polling game designed to reveal whether or not your thoughts align with those of others on a variety of subjects in one of six categories: <span class="environmental">Environmental</span>, <span class="ethical">Ethical</span>, <span class="financial">Financial</span>, <span class="healthandsafety">Health & Safety</span>, <span class="recreational">Recreational</span>, and <span class="socialandpolitical">Social/Political</span>.</h5>
    <h5>To get your natural, instinctive reaction, you have just 10 seconds to answer the daily question in each category before the screen will advance to the next question.  10 seconds per question means it only takes one minute to complete the game each day.  New questions are posted daily.  Play now and see your results after the last question!</h5>
